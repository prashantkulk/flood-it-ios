Flood It — Color Puzzle

## Subtitle
Strategic flood-fill with obstacles

## Description
Flood the board. One color at a time.

Flood It is a beautifully crafted puzzle game where you start from the top-left corner and spread your color across the entire board. Tap a color to absorb all matching adjacent cells into your flood region. Fill the whole grid before your moves run out.

Simple to learn. Deeply satisfying to master.

GORGEOUS VISUALS
Every cell is a hand-crafted gradient with layered highlights, bevels, and soft shadows — creating a "liquid glass" aesthetic that feels tactile and alive. Watch colors ripple outward in smooth wave animations as your flood region expands across the board.

100 LEVELS WITH PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY
Progress through 2 level packs — Splash (1–50) and Current (51–100). Start with pure color puzzles, then face increasingly complex obstacles as you advance. Earn up to 3 stars per level based on how efficiently you solve it. Collect stars to unlock the expert pack.

6 OBSTACLE TYPES
- Stones: Immovable blocks that force you to flood around them
- Ice: Multi-layer barriers that require multiple absorptions to clear
- Countdown tiles: Race against the clock — clear them before they expire
- Portals: Teleport your flood across the board through linked pairs
- Walls: Directional barriers between cells that block flood propagation
- Bonus tiles: 2x and 3x score multipliers for big-point moves

CASCADE CHAIN REACTIONS
Trigger cascading floods that chain across the board. Each cascade wave multiplies your score — stack combos by absorbing 4+ cells per move, then watch the multipliers climb. Master cascades to earn 3 stars on the toughest levels.

SCORING & COMBOS
Every move earns points based on cells absorbed. Chain combos by making large floods consecutively. Hit bonus tiles for score multipliers. Earn end-of-level bonuses for remaining moves and near-optimal play.

DAILY CHALLENGES
A fresh puzzle every single day — the same board for every player worldwide. Build your streak, earn stars, and share your results with beautiful score cards.

3 COLOR THEMES
Unlock new visual themes as you collect stars: Classic (default), Ocean (50 stars), and Sunset (100 stars). Each theme transforms the entire board with a distinct color palette.

SATISFYING SOUND DESIGN
Every color tap produces a tuned musical tone. Flood waves cascade with pitch-shifted clicks that rise as the wave expands. Win a level and hear a celebratory chord progression as confetti rains down.
