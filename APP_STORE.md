Flood It — Color Puzzle

## Subtitle
Satisfying flood-fill puzzles

## Description
Flood the board. One color at a time.

Flood It is a beautifully crafted puzzle game where you start from the top-left corner and spread your color across the entire board. Tap a color to absorb all matching adjacent cells into your flood region. Fill the whole grid before your moves run out.

Simple to learn. Deeply satisfying to master.

GORGEOUS VISUALS
Every cell is a hand-crafted gradient with layered highlights, bevels, and soft shadows — creating a "liquid glass" aesthetic that feels tactile and alive. Watch colors ripple outward in smooth wave animations as your flood region expands across the board.

150 HANDCRAFTED LEVELS
Progress through 30 level packs spanning 9x9, 12x12, and 15x15 grids. Each level is seeded for a unique, fair puzzle. Earn up to 3 stars per level based on how efficiently you solve it.

DAILY CHALLENGES
A fresh puzzle every single day. Build your streak, compete with yourself, and never run out of new boards to solve.

SATISFYING SOUND DESIGN
Every color tap produces a tuned musical tone. Flood waves cascade with pitch-shifted clicks that rise as the wave expands. Win a level and hear a celebratory chord progression as confetti rains down.
